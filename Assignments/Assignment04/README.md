#### Abstract Overview

Solving Sudoku puzzles using constraint satisfaction techniques.

The task in this assignment is to implement **AC3 constraint propagation**, **backtracking search**, and a driver. 

Functions are provided for AC3 and backtracking_search in modules [constraint_prop](constraint_prop.py) and [backtrack](backtrack.py). Both of these operate on a sudoku puzzle and update the current assignments. 

The sudoku module implements the class Sudoku that is derived from a CSP class (both in module [csp_lib](csp_lib))
