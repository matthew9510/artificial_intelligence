#### Abstract Overview

Implemented a standard cross_validation routine. 
Ultimately the driver runs a 10 fold cross validation using decision trees and neural networks.

Note: The data is only shuffled once, so that std_cv.cross_validation will use the same exact training and test data on each of the folds for both learners.
